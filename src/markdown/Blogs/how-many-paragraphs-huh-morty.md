Well, to be honest, I'm kind of grossed out with the sexual nature of how everything unfolded. I didn't know how sexual dragons were. I kind of just wanted to do some D&D stuff, y'know? Wow I really crononberg'd up the whole place huh Morty, just a bunch a cronenbergs walkin around. Rick, I don't like glowing rocks in the kitchen trash! You created a day care for my dad?

Allahu blehhhh Akbar! Hello Jerry, come to rub my face in urine again? Rikitikitavi, bitch! My appearance is designed to be familiar and to put you at ease.

I'm man enough to simply say, 'I'm going to poop', and I'd be honored to have Ron Howard involved. I just killed my family! I don’t care who they were! No! Look away! I'm making an egg, Mom! Ugh…! I'm making an egg! Looks like some sort of legally safe knockoff of an '80s horror character with miniature swords for fingers instead of knives!

Yes. He's a getaway driver with Asperger's and my butthole is a demolitions expert. Is he keeping his shoulders square? Oooooooh he's tryin'! Lookin' good! Because I don't respect therapy; because I'm a scientist; because I invent, transform, create, and destroy for a living, and when I don't like something about the world, I change it. And I don't think going to a rented office in a strip mall to listen to some agent of averageness explain which words mean which feelings has ever helped anyone do anything. I think it's helped a lot of people get comfortable and stop panicking, which is a state of mind we value in the animals we eat, but not something I want for myself. I'm not a cow, I'm a pickle... when I feel like it.
