Afroes creates uniquely African mobile applications and tools for social development agencies and corporate enterprises keen to spread educational and branded messages across the continent. It also represents an unprecedented opportunity to deliver branded and education messages directly and repeatedly into the hands and pockets of potential customers and citizens across the continent and beyond. Afroes is hosted by mLab.</p>\n<p>mLab CEO <a href=\"https://mlab.co.za\">Derrick Kotze</a> said “we are very excited that Afroes has won such a coveted prize. It is important for African based start-ups to get the opportunity to pitch in front of a global audience to win mind-share in the mobile innovation space. Anne is an amazing role model not only for young innovators and entrepreneurs but also for women across Africa.”</p>\n<p>For more info:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://mlab.co.za/about/\">https://mlab.co.za/about/</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://afroes.com/\">http://afroes.com/</a></p>"}},"pageContext":{"article":"/afroesdragonsden"}},
