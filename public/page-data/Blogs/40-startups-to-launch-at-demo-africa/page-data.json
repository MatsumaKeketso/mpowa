The 40 finalists have gone through three rigorous vetting processes with the final vetting and adjudication done by a pan-African panel of judges including entrepreneurs, VCs and Academia.</em></p>\n<p><em>“This has been a very enriching exercise seeing the kind of quality innovation coming out of Africa,” said Harry Hare, when announcing the names of the final 40. The process included several DEMO Africa innovation tours to encourage participation from technology startups from as many countries as possible.</em></p>\n<p><em>A total of 500 applications were processed in lead to this event, these were then short listed to 150 ventures two weeks ago and now the final 40. “It’s been a great pleasure working with the different entrepreneurs.

Now is the time to celebrate innovators from across the continent,” said Ben White, Founder, VC4Africa.</em></p>\n<p><em>The 40 cover five categories – Social Media, Cloud Services, Mobile, Consumer and Enterprise Technologies.  South Africa and Kenya take a big chunk of the final 40 with Ghana and Nigeria coming in a close second. Other countries represented included Cameroon, Senegal, Egypt, Tanzania and Zimbabwe.</em></p>\n<p><em>“Many entrepreneurs did not make the final cut despite having excellent ventures. We wish we could launch all of them at DEMO Africa, but that’s practically not possible,” said Hare. “We will however engage all of them and see how to assist them through the partnerships we have created to move their businesses to the next level,” he continued.</em></p>\n<p><em>The Judges included Martin Butler, Senior Lecturer, University of Stellenbosch, Athony Stonefield, Head of Ecosystem, Nokia, Toby Sharpshak, Editor, Stuff South Africa, Paul Nguru, CEO, PN Consultancy, Stephen Gugu, Director, Viktoria  Solutions,  Erik Hersman, Founder, Ushahidi/iHub, Eric Osaikwan, CEO, Research Africa, Tomi Davis, CEO, Technovision and  Brian Longwe, DEMO Africa.</em></p>\n<p><em>DEMO Africa is the flagship initiative of the Liberating Innovation in Opportunity Nations in Africa (LIONS@frica) Partnership and includes DEMO, Microsoft, InfoDEV, Nokia and US Department of State.
